## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Timestamp-based idempotency (not version parsing)
- Prefer `/gsd:*` naming with `/gsd-*` fallback
- Partial success acceptable (install what works, log failures)
- /gsdo enhances everything every run
- Separate logs (install.log vs gsdo.log)
- 7-day log rotation
- No backups or rollback (re-run installer for recovery)
