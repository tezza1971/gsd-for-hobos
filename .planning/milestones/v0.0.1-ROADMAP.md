# Milestone v0.0.1: Initial Release

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-23
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

A frictionless migration tool that transpiles GSD context engineering from Claude Code to OpenCode in 7 phases. Starting with core detection and basic transpilation, we layer on documentation caching, LLM enhancement, advanced transpilation features, idempotency, comprehensive logging, and final polish for a production-ready installer.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Installer

**Goal**: User can run installer and get transpiled GSD commands in OpenCode
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Detection Infrastructure
- [x] 01-02: Transpilation Engine
- [x] 01-03: OpenCode Integration

**Details:**
- Cross-platform path resolution and installation detection using Node.js built-ins with auto-creation of OpenCode config directory
- GSD installation detection validates ~/.claude/get-shit-done/skills/ directory exists
- OpenCode detection checks multiple candidate paths with fallback to auto-creation
- 19 unit tests verify cross-platform behavior and error handling

### Phase 2: Documentation Cache

**Goal**: Installer caches OpenCode documentation for /gsdo LLM context
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Cache Infrastructure & Download
- [x] 02-02: Cache Management & Integration

**Details:**
- Installer downloads OpenCode docs from GitHub on first run
- Docs cached in ~/.gsdo/cache/docs-opencode/ with timestamp
- Installer checks cache age and refreshes only if older than 24 hours
- Handles network failures gracefully with stale cache fallback

### Phase 3: /gsdo Command

**Goal**: User can run /gsdo in OpenCode to enhance transpiled commands
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Enhancement engine core with context loading and backup
- [x] 03-02: LLM integration and per-command enhancement logic
- [x] 03-03: /gsdo command installation and CLI integration

**Details:**
- Installer creates /gsdo command definition with references to install.log and cached docs
- /gsdo command reads install.log for transpilation context
- Reads cached OpenCode docs from ~/.gsdo/cache/
- Uses OpenCode's configured LLM to analyze all /gsd-* commands
- Operates autonomously without requesting user input

### Phase 4: Enhanced Transpilation

**Goal**: Installer extracts prompt templates and variables from GSD commands
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Template Extraction - Extract clean prompt templates from GSD markdown
- [x] 04-02: Variable Parser - Parse {{var}} patterns and add to schema
- [x] 04-03: Verbose Progress & Error Handling - Enhanced CLI output with partial success display

**Details:**
- Extracts prompt templates from GSD markdown files
- Parses template variables (e.g., {{phase}}, {{context}}) from templates
- Handles partial success (installs working commands, logs failures)
- Shows verbose progress during transpilation (detection, scanning, writing phases)

### Phase 5: Idempotency

**Goal**: Installer skips re-transpilation when GSD source is unchanged
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: State file infrastructure for tracking import history
- [x] 05-02: Freshness checking and CLI integration with skip logic

**Details:**
- Checks ~/.gsdo/last-imported-gsd for previous import timestamp
- Compares GSD source timestamps and skips transpilation if unchanged
- Shows "Already up to date" message when installer skips work
- Updates last-imported-gsd file after successful transpilation
- Uses caching to avoid redundant work (docs, transpilation)

### Phase 6: Exit Logging

**Goal**: All installer and /gsdo activity is logged in detailed, readable format
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Installer logging infrastructure with markdown/JSON hybrid format
- [x] 06-02: Enhancement logging and validation improvements
- [x] 06-03: Log rotation with daily rotation and 7-day retention

**Details:**
- Installer writes timestamped entries to ~/.gsdo/install.log with transpilation results
- Install log includes success/warnings/errors per command in markdown format
- /gsdo command writes timestamped entries to ~/.gsdo/gsdo.log with enhancement results
- /gsdo fixes naming issues, improves prompt templates, adds missing parameters, fixes broken references
- /gsdo updates commands.json in place with enhanced commands
- Both logs rotate automatically (keep only past 7 days)

### Phase 7: Polish

**Goal**: Installer provides excellent UX with clear messaging and fast performance
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Success screen with ASCII art and enhanced progress reporting
- [x] 07-02: Error handling, exit codes, and platform adaptation

**Details:**
- Requires zero user input and completes in under 10 seconds
- Shows ASCII art success screen with disclaimer about best-effort migration
- Success screen shows clear next steps (run /gsdo in OpenCode)
- Error messages are specific and actionable
- Partial success transparently shows what worked and what didn't
- Adapts command naming based on platform filesystem limitations

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Use Node.js built-in modules only - zero external dependencies for path resolution and core operations
- Two-pass architecture: Algorithmic transpilation (installer) + LLM enhancement (/gsdo command) for best-effort migration
- Timestamp-based idempotency instead of version parsing for simpler, more reliable change detection
- Prefer /gsd:* naming format everywhere (JSON keys work on all platforms; colons unsupported only in filenames)
- Partial success strategy: Install working commands even if some fail, log all issues transparently
- Autonomous operation: Zero user input throughout entire flow (installer + /gsdo)
- Log rotation with 7-day retention for balance between history and disk space

**Issues Resolved:**

- Resolved cross-platform path resolution for Windows, macOS, Linux with proper separators
- Solved idempotency problem with timestamp-based freshness checking
- Handled network failures in cache download with graceful fallback to stale cache
- Integrated LLM enhancement into OpenCode workflow via /gsdo command
- Achieved <10s performance target for typical 30-command installations
- Implemented 144-test coverage across all phases (100% passing)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - clean implementation across all phases
