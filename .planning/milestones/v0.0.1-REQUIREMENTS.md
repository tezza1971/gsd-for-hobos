## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Interactive CLI with prompts | Contradicts zero-input automation philosophy |
| Perfect parity with Claude Code GSD | Best-effort migration (80% target), not 1:1 replication |
| Backup and rollback mechanisms | Re-running installer is the recovery mechanism |
| Complex manifest/state tracking | Simple timestamp-based idempotency sufficient |
| Multiple platform support (Antigravity, Cursor) | OpenCode only for v1 |
| Separate API key management | Uses OpenCode's configured LLM |
| LLM in installer | Algorithmic only, LLM reserved for /gsdo command |
| GSD version management | User updates GSD via Claude Code separately |
| Conflict resolution/merging | Overwrite strategy sufficient |
| Strict schema validation | Best-effort approach, no validation errors |
| Custom GSD installation locations | Standard path only (`~/.claude/get-shit-done/`) |
