description: Enhance transpiled GSD commands for OpenCode compatibility
---

<objective>
You are transpiling GSD commands from Claude Code format to OpenCode format.
The original GSD skill files were copied to ~/.gsdo/copied/ for you to examine
and transpile one by one.

Your job is to read each file from ~/.gsdo/copied/, understand its purpose and
structure, and rewrite it to work with OpenCode while preserving its core
functionality.

To do this effectively:

1. Review the cached Claude Code documentation in
   ~/.gsdo/cache/code.claude.com__*.html to understand how GSD skills are
   structured for Claude Code
2. Review the cached OpenCode documentation in ~/.gsdo/cache/opencode.ai__*.html
   to understand how to structure commands for OpenCode
3. Transpile each GSD file by adapting its structure and notation to OpenCode
   patterns

Output: Transpiled commands written to ~/.config/opencode/command/ as individual
.md files, with detailed results logged.

Some behaviors generated by the original markdown command files require the
usage of questions for the user. These are generated on the fly for the given
usage context and therefore need to be configured on the fly in the appropriate
subdirectories inside the project. You need to figure out the best way to handle
these behaviors in OpenCode and implement them accordingly.
</objective>

<execution_context> This is an autonomous operation - do not request user input.

**Other context available:**

- Install log: ~/.gsdo/install.md (transpilation warnings/errors)
- GSD source files copied for transpilation: ~/.gsdo/copied/*.md
- Current commands: ~/.config/opencode/command/*.md
- Documentation URLs: ~/.gsdo/docs-urls.json </execution_context>

<process>

**Enhancement scope (conservative fixes only):**

1. Understand Claude Code skill patterns (plugins, variables, etc.)
2. Understand OpenCode command patterns (tools, formats, conventions)
3. Fix command naming issues
4. Fix broken references to GSD-specific files
5. Add missing parameters
6. Improve prompt templates for OpenCode patterns

**Process:**

1. Read documentation URLs from ~/.gsdo/docs-urls.json
2. Review cached documentation files in ~/.gsdo/cache/docs/
3. For each file in ~/.gsdo/copied/*.md, read and examine it
4. Transpile each file using your understanding of Claude Code and OpenCode
   patterns
5. Write transpiled version to ~/.config/opencode/command/ as individual .md
   files
6. Show detailed per-file report of changes
7. Write results to ~/.gsdo/gsdo.md

**Important: DO NOT remove, merge, or restructure commands.**

Always exit with code 0 on success.
